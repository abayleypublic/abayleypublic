## My Projects

### k3s Cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
[cluster](https://github.com/abayleypublic/cluster) | [apps](https://github.com/abayleypublic/apps)

I have deployed a k3s cluster on Oracle Cloud to host my applications and projects. I saw this as an opportunity to learn more about building a Kubernetes cluster using IaC. The cluster is bootstrapped using Terraform, a TaskFile is then used to install required dependencies at which point everything else is deployed via ArgoCD.

### Queue

Queue is a system to enable natural language modifications to queues. It is purposefully over-engineered to allow for discovery around AI, Temporal, MCP servers and observability.

### Roam to Rome / Activity Tracker

A service developed to enable tracking of activities against a challenge. I used this to track activities for a charity drive I completed by virtually walking the round trip of the distance from London to Rome, raising over Â£2500 in aid of Mind, a mental health charity.
